## What?

Do you want to know whether or not you have a few minutes to chill before walking to your favorite transportation station ?

I do, and that's why I created *should I chill or should I go*! 🎉

## Why?

This is a small project to play with:

- ⚛️ React
- 🦀 Rocket (Rust web framework)
- 🌐 Browser APIs (Location, LocalStorage)
- 🗺 Maps
- 🚆 Transportation APIs
- 🐋 Docker
- 🚀 Nginx
- :octocat: Github Actions CI/CD

## TODO:

- [ ] Improve Rocket backend
- [ ] Add frontend and backend tests
- [ ] Add a cookie(/LocalStorage) consent banner
- [ ] Add disruptions warning (https://doc.navitia.io/#line-reports)
